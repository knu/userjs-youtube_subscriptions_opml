# Download YouTube Subscriptions OPML

This is a user script for Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey that adds a "Download OPML" button to your YouTube Channel List page.

In order for this user script to work, you need to directly open https://www.youtube.com/feed/channels rather than navigating to the page via the menu and buttons because YouTube is a single page application.
